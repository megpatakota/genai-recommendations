## Overview

This project leverages **Generative AI (GenAI)** to deliver personalised experience recommendations to members based on:
- Their **profile information** (e.g., location, name).
- **Past redeemed offers** and **recent transactions**.
- Available experiences yet to be redeemed.

The service consists of:
1. **Backend Services**:
   - A Jinja2-based template system to dynamically create LLM-friendly prompts.
   - An integration with OpenAI's GPT models for natural language recommendations.
2. **Frontend**:
   - A simple **Streamlit UI** for user interaction and viewing recommendations.
3. **Deployment**:
   - Dockerised services for portability and ease of deployment.

## Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment using **Poetry**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genai-recommendations.git
cd genai-recommendations

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the application
poetry run streamlit run app.py
```

Alternatively, to use the Dockerised version:

```bash
docker build -t genai-recommendations .
docker run -p 8000:8000 genai-recommendations
```

## Prompt Design and Architecture

### Prompt Design

The recommendation engine uses **Jinja2 templates** to craft well-structured prompts that encapsulate:
- User profiles, past experiences, and recent transactions.
- Available experiences (not yet redeemed).
- A request for personalised recommendations tailored to this data.

Example Prompt Template:
```jinja2
## User Profile
**Name:** {{ name }}
**Location:** {{ location }}

## Past Experiences
{% if past_experiences %}
{% for exp in past_experiences %}
- **Experience Title:** {{ exp.title }}
  - **Category:** {{ exp.category }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
None
{% endif %}
...
```
[Full Template Code](./prompt.jinja2).

### Core Flow

1. **utils.py**:
   - Loads synthetic data from `data.json`.
   - Prepares the LLM-ready prompt via Jinja2.
   - Calls OpenAI GPT to fetch structured recommendations.

2. **app.py**:
   - Provides a **Streamlit-based interface** for users to input member IDs and view personalised recommendations.

---

## Data Structure

### Synthetic Dataset

The dataset includes:
1. **Members**:
   - `member_id`, `name`, `location`, `past_redeemed_offers`, and `card_transactions`.
2. **Experiences**:
   - `experience_id`, `title`, `category`, descriptions, price range, and availability dates.

Sample:
```json
{
    "members": [
        {
            "member_id": "M001",
            "name": "Alice",
            "location": "London",
            "past_redeemed_offers": [...],
            "card_transactions": [...]
        }
    ],
    "experiences": [
        {
            "experience_id": "E001",
            "title": "Gourmet Sushi Tasting",
            "category": "Food",
            "rating": 4.8,
            "available_dates": [...]
        }
    ]
}
```
---

## API Integration

The project includes a basic **FastAPI-based recommendation API**. 

### Endpoint

#### `/recommendations/{member_id}`
Fetches recommendations for a specific member.

- **Parameters**:  
  - `member_id` (path): Unique identifier for the member.
  - `output` (query): Format of response (`json` or `text`).

- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "member_id": "M001",
      "recommendations": [
          {
              "title": "Gourmet Sushi Tasting",
              "category": "Food",
              "explanation": "Based on your interest in high-end dining experiences..."
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

## Next Steps

1. **Production-Grade Deployment**:
   - Replace `data.json` with a proper database (e.g., PostgreSQL or DynamoDB).
   - Transition from Streamlit to a React-based front-end for public-facing applications.

2. **Performance Optimisation**:
   - Explore caching for LLM queries to reduce API costs and latency.
   - Implement batch processing for simultaneous recommendations.

3. **Security**:
   - Use `AWS Secrets Manager` or `Azure Key Vault` to manage API keys securely.
   - Implement JWT-based user authentication.

4. **Observability**:
   - Add structured logging with tools like `Datadog` or `Prometheus`.
   - Include error tracking using `Sentry`.
