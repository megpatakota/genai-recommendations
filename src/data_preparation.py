This module provides functionalities to prepare data for a Large Language Model (LLM)
prompt based on user (member) profile and transaction history, and to retrieve
recommendations from the LLM. It uses Jinja2 templating for prompt generation,
pydantic models for structured output, and the OpenAI API for LLM requests.

    Creates a prompt for the LLM based on a given member's profile and transaction data.

    The function gathers:
    - The member's basic info (name, location).
    - The member's past redeemed offers and categorizes them.
    - The available experiences that the member has not redeemed yet.
    - The member's card transactions (merchant, category, and amount).
    These details are then rendered into a Jinja2 template to form a structured prompt.
